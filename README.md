## About

ShopCART is a lightweight, educational e-commerce application intended to demonstrate a typical modern web application architecture: a front-end client (SPA), a back-end API, and a database for persistent storage. It contains core e-commerce flows such as product catalog, shopping cart, user authentication, and order checkout.

This repository is intended for:

* Learning full-stack development patterns.
* Quickly bootstrapping a demo e-commerce app.
* Extending into a production-ready app with payments, analytics, etc.

---

## Features

* Product listing, details, and search
* Add-to-cart and cart management
* User signup/login (JWT or session-based)
* Checkout flow (mock payment or integration point)
* Order history and order management
* Admin area for product CRUD (optional)
* RESTful API and client-side SPA

---

## Tech Stack (example)

> Replace with the actual stack used in your project. The list below is a common example.

* Frontend: React (Create React App / Vite)

* State: Redux / Context API

* Styling: Tailwind CSS or plain CSS / SASS

* Containerization: Docker

* Testing: Jest / React Testing Library

---

## Folder Structure (example)

```
shopcart/
├─ client/                 
├─ scripts/               
├─ docker-compose.yml
├─ Dockerfile.server
├─ Dockerfile.client
├─ .env.example
└─ README.md

```

(Adjust to match your repository layout.)

---

## Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

* Git
* Node.js (LTS recommended)
* npm or yarn

### Clone & Install

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ShopCART.git
cd ShopCART

# if the repo has separate client & server
cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install

```

### Run (Development)


```bash
cd ShopCART
npm run dev     

# json server
cd ShopCART/data
json-server --watch data.json --port 5000

```


---

## Production / Docker

A Docker-based setup makes running the full stack locally or on a server easier.

```bash
# Build and run with docker-compose
docker-compose up --build
```

Provide `docker-compose.yml` with services for `client`, `server`, and `db`. Map ports and set environment variables via `.env` or `docker-compose.override.yml`.

---

## API (example endpoints)

> Adapt to the actual API implemented in your server.

```
POST   /api/auth/register      # user registration
POST   /api/auth/login         # login -> returns JWT
GET    /api/products           # list products (with query params)
GET    /api/products/:id       # product details
POST   /api/cart               # add to cart (or client-only)
PUT    /api/cart/:itemId       # update cart item
POST   /api/checkout           # create order (mock/payment)
GET    /api/orders             # list user orders
GET    /api/admin/orders       # admin: all orders
```

Return formats should be JSON with consistent response envelope.

---

## Testing

If tests exist, run them with:

```bash
#  tests
cd ShopCART
npm test

```

Add unit and integration tests for critical logic (cart math, auth flows, order creation).

---

## Linting & Formatting

Use ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Example:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Add a Git pre-commit hook (husky) to run linting and tests.

---

## Deployment Recommendations

* Use managed services: Vercel/Netlify for frontend; Heroku, Railway, or DigitalOcean App Platform for backend.
* Use managed DB: MongoDB Atlas or RDS for Postgres.
* Use environment variables and secrets manager; do not store secrets in repo.
* Add HTTPS, rate limiting, and CORS configuration on the API.
* For payments, integrate Stripe (test keys first).
